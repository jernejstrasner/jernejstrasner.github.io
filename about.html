<div id="about">
    <p>I’m intrigued by user interface design, human-computer interaction and parallel and distributed programming.
        I’m currently focusing on iOS development, user experience design and product design.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm VP Mobile Development at <a href="http://iddiction.com" target="_blank">Iddiction, Inc.</a></p>
    <p>Other than that, I'm a fan of cars, especially those with internal combustion engines (still remember them?).
        I also play bass guitar and try to think I'm good at it. I just started rowing again this year and I'm trying to get back into good shape.</p>
