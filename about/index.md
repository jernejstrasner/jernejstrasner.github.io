I’m intrigued by user interface design, human-computer interaction and parallel and distributed programming.
I’m currently focusing on iOS development, user experience design and product design.

Currently, I'm VP Mobile Development at [Iddiction, Inc.](http://iddiction.com)

Other than that, I'm a fan of cars, especially those with internal combustion engines (still remember them?).
I also play bass guitar and try to think I'm good at it. I just started rowing again this year and I'm trying to get back into good shape.
